title: If I Were a Butterfly
key: D

If I were a butterfly
I’d thank you Lord for giving me wings 
If I were a robin in a tree
I’d thank you Lord that I could sing
If I were a fish in the sea,
I’d wiggle my tail and I’d giggle with glee
But I just thank you father for making me me

>You gave me a heart and you gave me a smile 
You gave me Jesus and you made me Your child
And I just thank you Father for making me me

If I were an elephant,
I’d thank you Lord by raising my trunk
If I were a kangaroo,
You know I’d hop right up to you
If I were an octopus,
I’d thank you Lord for my fine looks
But I just thank you Father for making me me

If I were a wiggly worm,
I’d thank you Lord that I could squirm
If I were a fuzzy wuzzy bear,
I’d thank you Lord for my fuzzy, wuzzy hair If I were a crocodile,
I’d thank you Lord for my great smile
But I just thank you Father for making me me

I'm gonna sing, sing, sing,
I'm gonna shout, shout, shout, 
I'm gonna sing, I'm gonna shout 
Praise the Lord
When those gates are open wide, 
I'm gonna sit at Jesus' side 
I'm gonna sing, I'm gonna shout 
Praise the Lord

Swing low,sweet chariot, 
Coming for to carry me home 
Swing low, sweet chariot, 
Coming for to carry me home

O, when the saints go marching in, 
O, when the saints go marching in, 
How I want to be in that number, 
When the saints go marching in.

This train is bound for Glory, this train
This train is bound for Glory, this train 
This train is bound for Glory
Those who ride it will be holy 
This train is bound for Glory, this train

I'm gonna sing, sing, sing,
I'm gonna shout, shout, shout, 
I'm gonna sing, I'm gonna shout 
Praise the Lord
When those gates are open wide, 
I'm gonna sit at Jesus' side 
I'm gonna sing, I'm gonna shout 
Praise the Lord

Who's the king of the jungle?  
Who's the king of the sea?  
Who's the king of the universe,  
and who's the king of me?  

>I'll tell you: J-E-S-U-S is,  
he's the king for me;  
he's the king of the universe,  
the jungle and the sea.  

Who's the king of the forest?
Who's the king of the trees?
Who's the king of the universe,
The forest and the trees?
Whoâ€™s the King of the Jungle?

Who's the king of the desert?
Who's the king of the swamp?
Who's the king of the universe,
The desert and the swamp?

Who's the king of the backyard?
Who's the king of the house?
Who's the king of the universe,
The backyard and the house?

>Hey, hey, Mon, do you know my Lord? 
Hey, hey, Mon, do you know my Lord? 
Tell de people from door to door 
Say â€” Hey Mon, do you know my Lord?

Well all de people in de islands play 
In de sunshine every day
But Jesus come to show the way 
And teach His children how to pray.

Well de big fat woman in de market place 
She yell so loud she get red in de face. 
She preach de gospel every day,
If you listen you can hear her say

De voodoo doctor he came to say
That his demons they want to play
But de Christians they start to pray
In Jesus' name, they scare the demons away!

He cried whoa!
Show me the way, show me the way,
Show me the way, the way to go home.

The woman stood by the well and she cried (3x) 
She cried whoa!
Show me the truth, show me the truth,
Show me the truth, the way to go home.

Lazarus laid in the grave and they cried (3x) 
They cried, whoa!
Show us the life, show us the life, 
Show us the life, the way to go home.

I am the Way, I am the Truth,
I am the Life, and the Way to go home Jesus!

title: Come to the Island
key: C

Missionary came to the island people
Taught them all of Jesus love
Made a little church with a bamboo steeple
Pointing up to God above
Missionary said I have to leave now
All the island people cried
How do we know what to believe
How can we learn without a guide

+He said every Bible
is an island full of gems
Truth and hope are yours 
if you just dig for them, so

>Come to the island, 
Search for the treasure
Find a good measure of truth hope and life
Someday we'll meet 
in that sweet by and by land
That beautiful island of God's paradise

Everybody needs some gems to guide them
Little rocks along the way
Everybody needs to search to find them
In the Bible everyday


+Are you digging diamonds
Is your treasure hunt worthwhile
Or is your Bible lonesome 
as a desert isle? Oh

>Come to the island, 
Search for the treasure
Find a good measure of truth hope and life
Someday we'll meet 
in that sweet by and by land
That beautiful island of God's paradise

>In the sweet by and by
We shall meet on that beautiful shore
In the sweet by and by
We shall meet on that beautiful shore

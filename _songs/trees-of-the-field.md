They shall go out with joy
and be led forth with peace.
The mountains and the hills
will break forth before You;
There shall be shouts of joy,
And all the trees of the field
will clap, will clap their hands.

And all the trees of the field will clap their hands.
The trees of the field will clap their hands.
The trees of the field will clap their hands.
As we go out with joy!

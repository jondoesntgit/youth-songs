title: If You Believe

When David stood 
Before the giant with his sling, 
Goliath laughed 
At such a puny little thing.
But David knew 
His faith in God would stand the test
He flung the rock, 
God did the rest.

>If you believe, you shall receive. 
There’s not a trouble or care
The good Lord can’t relieve.
Oh, He is just the same today;
All you got to do is trust Him and pray, 
And believe, you must believe.

When Daniel was 
Inside the hungry lion’s den, 
Nobody thought 
That there was any hope for him. 
The long night thru, 
Those lions never took a bite. 
God took away their appetite.

I heard about 
When Paul and Silas were in jail.
Nobody there, 
Nobody there would pay their bail. 
But when they prayed, 
They knew that God was on their side,
The jail house door swung open wide.

The disciples went in their boat 
Out on the lake.
The storm winds came,
They thought their boat would break 
But then they cried
To Jesus in despair
He calmed the storm 
Then rebuked their fear.


Near the end of time, When to do right is a crime 
The Devil says
That to kill saints will be fine 
But they don’t care
Cause they would rather die than sin
Cause Jesus is their very best friend.

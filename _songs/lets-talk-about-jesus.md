Let's talk about Jesus,
The King of Kings is He.
The Lord of Lords supreme Through all eternity,
The great I am the Way,
The Truth the Life, the Door; 
Let's talk about Jesus more and more.

Oh my lovin' brother, when the world's on fire, 
Don't you want God's bosom to be your pillow? 
O hide me over, in the Rock of Ages, 
Rock of Ages, cleft for me.

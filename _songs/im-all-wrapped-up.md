I'm all wrapped up, I'm all tied up. I'm all tangled up in Jesus. 
I'm all wrapped up, I'm all tied up. I'm all tangled up in God.
I'm all wrapped up, I'm all tied up. I'm all tangled up in Jesus.
I'm all wrapped up, tied up, tangled up in God.

Well, I’m inside and I’m outside And I’m side by side with Jesus
Well, I’m inside and I’m outside And I’m side by side with God
Well, I’m inside and I’m outside And I’m side by side with Jesus
Well, I’m inside, outside, side by side with God

Well I’m alright and I’m upright And I’m living right with Jesus
Well I’m alright and I’m upright And I’m living right with God
Well I’m alright and I’m upright And I’m living right with Jesus
Well I’m alright, upright, living right with God

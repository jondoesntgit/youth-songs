title: My God is so Great
key: G
---

My God is so great, so strong and so mighty, 
there's nothing my God cannot do.
My God is so great, so strong and so mighty, 
there's nothing my God cannot do.
The mountains are his, the rivers are his, 
the stars are His handiwork, too.
My God is so great, so strong and so mighty, 
there's nothing my God cannot do, for you!

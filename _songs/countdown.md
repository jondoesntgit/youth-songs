title: Countdown
---

Somewhere in outer space
God has prepared a place
For those who trust Him and obey.
Jesus will come again,
And though we don't know when,
The countdown's getting lower every day.

>Ten and nine,
eight and seven
six and five and four.
Call upon the Savior while you may.
Three and two, coming through
the clouds in bright array.
The countdown's getting lower every day.

Jesus was crucified:
For all our sins He died,
But on the cross He did not stay.
He gave His promise true:
"I will come back for you."
The countdown's getting lower every day!

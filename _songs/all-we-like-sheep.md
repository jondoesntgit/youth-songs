All we like sheep
Have gone astray
And the Lord has laid
My sins on him
And the Lord has laid on him
the iniquities of us all

He was despised and rejected of men
He was despised and rejected of men
And the Lord has laid
My sins on him
And the Lord has laid on him
the iniquities of us all

A man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief
A man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief
And the Lord has laid
My sins on him
And the Lord has laid on him
the iniquities of us all

We have turned every one to his own ways
We have turned every one to his own ways
And the Lord has laid
My sins on him
And the Lord has laid on him
the iniquities of us all

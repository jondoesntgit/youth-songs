> Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet And a light unto my path
Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet And a light unto my path

When I feel afraid Think I've lost my way
Still You're there right beside me And nothing will I fear
As long as You are near Please be near me to the end

I will not forget
Your love for me and yet
My heart forever is wandering Please be my guide
and hold me to Your side And I will love You to the end

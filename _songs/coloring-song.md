Red is the color of the blood that flowed
down the face of Someone who loved us so.
He's the perfect Man
He's The Lord's Own Son
He's the Lamb of God He's the only One
That can give us life that can make us grow
That can make the love between us flow.

Blue is the color of a heart so cold
That will not bend when the story's told
Its the love of God for a sinful race
Its the blood that flowed down Jesus face
That can give us life that can make us grow
That can keep our hearts from growing cold

Gold is the color of the morning Son 
that shines so freely on everyone
Its the sun above that keeps us warm
Its the Son of Love that calms the storm 
That can give us life that can make us grow 
That can turn our mourning into Gold

Brown is the color of the autumn leaves 
when the winter comes to the barren trees 
There is birth there is death, there is a plan
for there's just one God and there's just one Man 
That can give us life that can make us grow 
That can make our sins as white as snow

That can turn our mourning into gold. 
That can keep our hearts from growing cold. 
That can give us life, that can make us grow
That can make the love between us flow.

Let us come together praise the Name of Jesus 
All the people 'round the world come and see 
Let us come together praise the Name of Jesus 
All the people 'round the world come and hear

Joy is like a sunshine
Let it raining down upon us
Joy is like a golden crown 
Let us come together 
Praise the name of Jesus

Allelujah! Allelujah! Allelujah! Allelujah! 
Allelujah! Allelujah! Allelujah! Allelujah!

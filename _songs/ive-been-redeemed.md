I've been redeemed
By the blood of the Lamb
I've been redeemed
By the blood of the Lamb
I've been redeemed
By the blood of the Lamb
Filled with His Holy Ghost I am
All my sins are washed away
I've been redeemed

And that's not all
There's more besides
And that's not all
There's more besides
And that's not all
There's more besides
I've been to the river
and I've been baptized
All my sins are washed away
I've been redeemed

You can talk about me
Just as much as you please
You can talk about me
Just as much as you please
You can talk about me
Just as much as you please
I'll talk about you down on my knees
All my sins are washed away
I've been redeemed

Now the devil's mad
and I am glad
Now the devil's mad
and I am glad
Now the devil's mad
and I am glad
He lost a soul he thought he had
All my sins are washed away
I've been redeemed

He's coming back
To take us home
He's coming back
To take us home
He's coming back
To take us home
So he can reap what he has sown
All my sins are washed away
I've been redeemed

But until then
We'll work the fields
But until then
We'll work the fields
But until then
We'll work the fields
And see what the Holy Spirit yields
All my sins are washed away
I've been redeemed

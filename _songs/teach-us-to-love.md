>Teach us to love, Lord,
Better each day,
Our fellow man, Lord, because
There’s no other way.

When I grow fat, Lord,
someone grows lean. 
Don’t let me put my brother down,
he’s a child of the King

Look what we’ve done, Lord,
to Thy rich earth. 
All of our hate, greed, and pride
has canceled its worth.

All that I am, Lord,
all that I do,
All that I ever will become,
I give now to you.

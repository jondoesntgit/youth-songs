>Oh fill it up. Fill it up and let it overflow.
Oh fill it up. Fill it up and let it overflow.
Oh fill it up. Fill it up and let it overflow.
Let it overflow with Love.

Amazing grace how sweet the sound.
That saved a wretch like me.
I once was lost but now am found,
was blind but now I see.

Zaccheus was a wee little man.
A little man was he.
He climbed up in a sycamore tree,
for the Lord he wanted to see.

Jesus loves me, this I know.
For the Bible tells me so.
Little ones to Him belong
They are weak but He is strong

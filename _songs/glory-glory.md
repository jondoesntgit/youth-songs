Glory, glory, hallelujah, 
since I laid my burdens down
Glory, glory, hallelujah, 
since I laid my burdens down

I feel better, so much better
Since I laid my burdens down
I feel better, so much better
Since I laid my burdens down

>Singing glory glory, glory hallelujah
Glory glory, glory hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah hallelujah
Since I laid my burdens down

Friends don’t treat me, 
like they used to, 
since I laid my burdens down
Friends don’t treat me, 
like they used to, 
since I laid my burdens down

Tell me who is your blood brother 
Jesus shed his blood for you 
Loves you more than any other 
Jesus loves you more
He is your blood brother 
He is your blood brother

They nailed his hands they nailed his feet 
Hung my Jesus on a tree
On his head a thorny crown
Pierced his side The blood flowed down 

On a hill called Calvary
Jesus shed his blood for me
He is my blood brother 
He is my blood brother

Tell me who is your blood brother 
Jesus shed his blood for you 
Loves you more than any other 
Jesus loves you more
He is your blood brother 
He is your blood brother

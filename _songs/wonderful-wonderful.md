Wonderful, wonderful
Yes my Lord is wonderful
Isn’t Jesus my Lord wonderful 
Eyes have seen, ears have heard
It’s recorded in God’s word,
Isn’t Jesus my Lord wonderful

Wonderful, marvelous
That our Savior died for us
Long ago, far away, on a tree
Soon He’s coming back for me
What a glorious day will be
When at last my dear Savior I see

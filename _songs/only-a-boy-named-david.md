Only a boy named David, 
Only a little sling.
Only a boy named David, 
but he could play and sing.
Only a boy named David, 
Only a rippling brook.
Only a boy named David, 
but five little stones he took.


And one little stone
went into the sling, 
and the sling
went round and round.
And one little stone
went into the sling, 
and the sling
went round and round.


And round, and round, 
and round, and round, 
and round, and round, and round.
And one little stone 
went up in the air, 
and the giant came tumbling down.

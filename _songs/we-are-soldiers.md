We are soldiers, in the army
we have to fight,
although we have to die
we have to hold up the blood-stained banner
we have to hold it up until we die

Now ___ they were soldiers
They had their hand on the gospel plow
One day they got old, 
they couldn't fight anymore they said 
Stand up and fight anyhow!

Read your Bible, pray every day,
Pray every day, pray every day,
Read your Bible, pray every day,
And you’ll grow, grow, grow, (3x)
Read your Bible, pray every day,
And you’ll grow, grow, grow.

Neglect your Bible, forget to pray,
Forget to pray, forget to pray,
Neglect your Bible, forget to pray,
And you’ll shrink, shrink, shrink, (3x)
Neglect your Bible, forget to pray,
And you’ll shrink, shrink, shrink.

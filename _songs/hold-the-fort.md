title: Hold the Fort

Ho! my comrades, see the signal, 
Waving in the sky!
Reinforcements now appearing, 
Victory is nigh!

>Hold the fort, for I am coming,
Jesus signals still,
Wave the answer back to Heaven, 
By Thy grace we will. 

See the mighty host advancing,
Satan leading on;
Mighty men around us falling,
Courage almost gone.

See the glorious banner waving, 
Hear the bugle blow;
In our Leaderâ€™s Name we triumph 
Over every foe.

Fierce and long the battle rages, 
But our help is near;
Onward comes our great Commander, 
Cheer, my comrades, cheer!

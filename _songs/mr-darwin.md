Mr. Darwin, I address to you 
The subject of this song
I hope you’re not offended 
When I tell you that you’re wrong
But when you tell me that 
My ancestor’s a flower or a tree
Mr. Darwin, I have to disagree

You said that we were slimy once
And crawled out of the sea
And though I am no scientist
I know that wasn’t me
I don’t know just what possessed you
To say all the things you said
But when Jesus comes, your face will sure be red!

>For it was God who formed me from the dust
And He gave my body shape
And it is He that I descended from
And not some hairy ape!
And it is He that loves and cares for me 
This much I know is true
Mr. Darwin, Jesus Christ loves you!

I have a little dog at home
He’s got a lot to give
And though he is my furry friend 
He’s not my relative
And when I go into the zoo
to look at all the living things
It’s just a visit, not a family gathering!

I cannot condemn you
For the things you tried to say 
All I know is that you and I 
Were never made that way
And though my little furry friends 
Show similarities
Let’s not make a monkey out of me!

Mr. Darwin, when the life you led
In heaven’s courts is tried
I hope you changed the tune you sang 
Sometime before you died
For when Jesus comes He’s gonna take 
His children off the ground
And you might just have to stick around!

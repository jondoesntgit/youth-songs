I will sing of the mercies of the Lord forever,
I will sing, I will sing,
I will sing of the mercies of the Lord forever,
I will sing of the mercies of the Lord

With my mouth will I make known
Thy faithfulness, they faithfulness
With my mouth will I make known
Thy faithfulness to all generations

O give thanks unto the Lord,
O give thanks unto the Lord,
O give thanks unto the Lord,
He is good.

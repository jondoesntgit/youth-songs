If you're glad that you're a Christian clap your hands
If your sins have been forgiven clap your hands
Point to heaven in the sky
Then shake hands with one nearby
If the Lord can satisfy, clap your hands
Clap your hands Clap your hands
If you're glad that you're a Christian clap your hands

If you're not ashamed of Jesus raise your hand
If you've taken your stand for Jesus take your stand
Now sit down and rest a while
Turn to someone with a smile
If you're happy all the while clap your hands
Clap your hands Clap your hands
If you're glad that you're a Christian clap your hands

When I was just a little child  
No higher than your knee,  
My mother bought a box of crayons,  
Just for me.  
I picked them up and I opened them up  
And I looked way down inside,  
And the colors there reminded me  
Of Jesus when He died.  

>Red is the color of the blood that He shed,  
Brown is for the crown of thorns they laid upon His head.  
Blue is for royalty! In Heaven He does dwell;  
And yellow is for the Christian who's afraid to tell.  

I colored and I colored  
'Til the crayons were all gone,  
And though I am much older now,  
The mem'ry lingers on.  
And when I see a little child  
With crayon box in hand,  
I tell them what they mean to me  
And hope they'll understand.  

Afraid to tell the story  
of Christ on Calvary,  
He died for lowly sinners  
Just like you and me;  
Someday soon He's coming back  
Back to be our King,  
And the colors of the crayon box  
We will sing!

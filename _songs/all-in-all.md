You are my Strength when I am weak. 
You are the Treasure that I seek, 
You are my All in All
Seeking You as a precious Jewel, 
Lord to give up, I'd be a fool,
You are my All in All.

>Jesus, Lamb of God.
Worthy is Your name. 
Jesus, Lamb of God
Worthy is Your name.

Taking my sin, my cross, my shame.
Rising again, I bless Your name.
You are my All in All
When I fall down,
you pick me up,
When I am dry you fill my cup,
You are my All in All.

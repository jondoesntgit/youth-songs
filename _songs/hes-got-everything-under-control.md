[x] foo 480 years old was the prophet Noah
when the Lord said build a boat.
He said a flood would come and cover the earth.
And only Noah would stay afloat.
Well the people laughed and called him names,
but he stuck right with his job.
When he saw those drops He knew his God,
had everything under control

>He’s got everything under control
He’s got everything under control.
The stars and the planets are in His hands.
The wind and the rains at His command.
You and I are part of His plan.
He’s got everything under control.

Nebuchadnezzar nearly lost his religion 
when those Hebrews wouldn’t bow down.
He lost his cool, fired up the furnace
called a holiday in that town.
When he threw them in they begin to grin
because they knew what we all know, 
that the God who let that fire burn
had everything under control.

He’s got everything under control
He’s got everything under control.
The stars and the planets are in His hands.
The wind and the rains at His command.
You and I are part of His plan.
He’s got everything under control.

Daniel was invited to be on the menu
At the meeting of the Lions club
'cause he continued to pray three times a day 
To the God he’d learned to love
When they threw him in, he begin to grin, 
Because he knew what we all know
That the God who let those lions roar 
Had everything under control

He’s got everything under control
He’s got everything under control.
The stars and the planets are in His hands.
The wind and the rains at His command.
You and I are part of His plan.
He’s got everything under control.

Jonah had a whale of a problem 
when he turned that revival down.
God tracked him down and boxed him in 
because he wouldn’t go to that town.
When He wants you to do what He wants you to do 
don’t think you can let it roll
Cause the God who made this universe 
has everything under control

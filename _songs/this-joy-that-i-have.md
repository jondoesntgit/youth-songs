This joy that I have, 
the world didn't it give to me
this joy I have, 
the world didn't give to me
this joy I have, 
the world didn't give it to me
the world didn't give it, 
and the world can't take it away

This peace that I have
The world didn't give it to me
This peace that I have
The world didn't give it to me
This peace that I have
The world didn't give it to me
The world didn't give it 
And the world can't take it away

This love that I have
The world didn't give it to me
This love that I have
The world didn't give it to me
This love that I have
The world didn't give it to me
The world didn't give it 
And the world can't take it away

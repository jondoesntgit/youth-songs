Would you be free from the burden of sin?
There's pow'r in the blood, power in the blood.
Would you o'er evil a victor win?
There's wonderful power in the blood.

>There is power, power
Wonder-working power
In the blood of the Lamb
There is power, power
Wonder-working power
In the precious blood of the Lamb

Would you be free from your passion and pride?
There's power in the blood, power in the blood
Come for a cleansing to Calvary's tide
There's wonderful power in the blood

Would you do service for Jesus your King?
There's power in the blood, power in the blood
Would you live daily His praises to sing?
There's wonderful power in the blood

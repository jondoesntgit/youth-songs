title: Jonah and the Whale

Come listen to my tale
Of Jonah and the whale
Way down in the middle of the ocean!
How did he get there...(Where?)
Whatever did he wear...(Where?)
Way down in the middle of the ocean!

A preacher he should be
To Nineveh you see
To disobeyâ€™s a very foolish notion!
But God forgave his sin 
Salvation entered in
Way down in the middle of the ocean

Seek ye first the kingdom of God, 
And His righteousness,
And all these things, shall be added onto you, 
Alleu, Alleuia

Man shall not live by bread alone, 
But by every word
That proceeds from the mouth of God 
Alleu, Alleuia

Ask and it shall be given unto you,
Seek and ye shall find.
Knock and the door shall be opened onto you. 
Alleu, Alleuia

title: In My Heart There Rings a Melody
key: G
---

I have a song that Jesus gave me, 
It was sent from heaven above; 
There never was a sweeter melody, 
'Tis a melody of love.

>In my heart there rings a melody, 
There rings a melody with heaven's harmony; 
In my heart there rings a melody, 
There rings a melody of love.

'Twill be my endless theme in glory, 
With the angels I will sing;
'Twill be a song with glorious harmony, 
When the courts of heaven ring

title: Dare to be a Daniel
key: E
---

Standing a purpose firm, 
heeding God’s command
Honor them the faithful few 
All hail to Daniel’s band

>Dare to be a Daniel,
Dare to sand alone,
Dare to have a purpose firm
Dare to make it known.

Many giants, great and tall, 
Stalking through the land
Headlong to the earth would fall, 
If met by Daniels band

Hold the gospel banner high, 
On to victory grand
Satan and his host defy, 
And shout for Daniel’s band

Many mighty men are lost, 
Daring not to stand,
Hold the gospel banner high, 
On to victory grand

title: Silver and Gold Have I None

Peter and John went to pray.
They met a lame man on the way
He asked for alms and held out his palms,
And this is what Peter did say

Silver and gold have I none,
But such as I have give I thee,
In the name of Jesus Christ
of Nazareth, rise up and walk.

He went walking and leaping
and praising God,
Walking and leaping
and praising God,
In the name of Jesus Christ
of Nazareth, rise up and walk.

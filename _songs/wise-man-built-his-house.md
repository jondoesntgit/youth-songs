The wise man built his house upon the rock, (3x) 
And the rains came tumbling down!
The rains came down and the floods came up, (3x)
And the house on the rock stood firm.

The foolish man built his house upon the sand, (3x)
And the rains came tumbling down!
The rains came down and the floods came up, (3x)
And the house on the sand went SPLAT!

Build your house on the Rock Jesus Christ (3x)
and the Blessings will come down.
Bessings will come down as the prayers go up, (3x)
So build your house on the Lord!

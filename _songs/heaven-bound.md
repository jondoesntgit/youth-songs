>Tell me now, where are you going? 
I’m on my way to heaven
Tell me now, how will you get there? 
Jesus is the way
Tell me now, can I go with you? 
Yes, there’s room for many more 
Let’s start our journey now Heaven bound

I wandered into emptiness 
By being my own guide
And every smile just covered up 
The brokenness inside
And when I felt God calling me 
I tried to run and hide
And love was just a word until 
He spread His arms and died

title: Did You Ever Talk to God
---

Did you ever talk to God above?
Tell Him that you need a friend to love.
Pray in Jesus' name believing that God answers prayer.

Have you told Him all your cares and woes?
Every tiny little fear He knows.
You can know He'll always hear
And He will answer prayer.

You can whisper in a crowd to Him
You can cry when you're alone to Him
You don't have to pray out loud to Him:
He knows your thoughts.

On a lofty mountain peak He's there.
In a meadow by a stream He's there.
Anywhere on Earth you go, 
He's been there from the start.

Find the answer in His Word; it's true:
You'll be strong because He walks with you.
By His faithfulness He'll change you, too:
God answers prayer.
